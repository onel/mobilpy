mobilPy
=======

mobilPy helps you with everything you need to implement
`mobilPay <https://www.mobilpay.ro/public/en/>`__'s online payment
solution. Steps: - create an account - get approved - create a merchant
- download keys (private and public) - copy the signature (just a
string)

*NOTE* You will have two private keys: for testing and production. The
public key is the same.

Install
-------

To install the library, run:

.. code:: sh

    pip install mobilpy

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from mobilpy import Client

    # the signature for your account
    signature = 'DLAN-1R5V-19EN-XXXX-NFJA'
    # the path to the public key
    public_key = "./sandbox.DLAN-1R5V-19EN-XXXX-NFJA.public.cer"
    # the private_key
    private_key = "./sandbox.DLAN-1R5V-19EN-XXXX-NFJA.private.key"

    client = Client(signature=signature, public_key=public_key, private_key=private_key)

    # optional dict containing details about the customer
    # if they are sent, the customer will have a short checkout by skipping the second step in the payment flow
    billing_details = {
        "first_name": "",
        "last_name": "",
        "address": "",
        "phone": "",
        "email": ""
    }
    # optional dict with details that you would need internally
    # these are returned when the webhook is called
    params = {
        "subscription_id": "",
        "basket_id": "",
        etc.
    }

    options = {
        "order_id": "" # int/string, max 64 length
        "currency": "RON", # string, RON or other
        "amount": 1, # float, between 0.10 and 99999
        "customer_id": "", # int/string
        "details": "",  # string, description for this transaction
        "billing": billing_details, # dict, OPTIONAL
        "params": params, # dict, OPTIONAL,
        
        # the webhook where the response from mobilPay will be sent
        "confirm_url": "",
        # the url where the user will be redirected
        "return_url": ""
    }
    response = client.create_payment_data(**options)

The ``response`` is an dict that has two keys: ``env_key`` and ``data``.
These need to be used in the front end and make the request to mobilPay.

For example, the HTML might look like this:

.. code:: html

    <form action="http://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="env_key" value="{{ env_key }}">
        <input type="hidden" name="data" value="{{ data }}">
        
        <input type="submit" value="Send">
    </form>

The POST urls for the form are:

testing:
  ``http://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro`` 
production:
  ``https://secure.mobilpay.ro``

Webhook
-------

mobilPay will make a ``POST`` request to the url you set as
``confirm_url``. mobilPy has methods to help you parse it and offer a
response.

.. code:: python

    post = # get the post data
    env_key = post.get('env_key')
    data = post.get('data')

    client = Client(signature=signature, public_key=public_key, private_key=private_key)

    request_xml = client.decrypt_message(env_key, data)
    request_object = client.parse_webhook_request(request_xml)

    # do some magic

In order to check if the transaction was successful you need to check
``error_code`` AND ``action``:

.. code:: python

    transaction_successful = request_object.get('error_code') == '0' and request_object.get('action') == 'confirmed'
    if transaction_successful:
      # everything is ok

Creating a response
-------------------

You need to let mobilPay know if everything is ok on your end or if
something weird happened. If everything is ok you can create a response
like this:

.. code:: python

    message = "All good captain"
    response_xml = client.create_reponse(message=message)

If you had an error:

.. code:: python

    # message that will help you debug. it will appear in your dashboard
    message = "Everything is on fire"
    # this can be "1" (temporary error) or "2" (permanent error)
    error_type = "1"
    # your internal error code. a number maybe. OPTIONAL
    error_code = ''
    response_xml = client.create_reponse(message=message, error_type=error_type, error_code=error_code)

The response doesn't need to be encrypted. Just respond with the xml.

Crediting
---------

If a transaction was credited from the Dashboard, mobilPay will make a
new webhook ``POST``. You can check for that:

.. code:: python

    # if the transaction was credited from mobilpay
    if request_object.get('action') == 'credit':
      # do something
      # return a reponse

TODO
====

Some things that still need to be done:

- tests
- add support for: instalements, recurrence
- maybe add prefilled credit card data payments?
